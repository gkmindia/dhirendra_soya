                <p>We produce Soya de-oiled cake which is used as an organic supplement, extracted from leftover soybean seeds after oil extraction and it is an excellent source of protein and micronutrients. This is used as a major ingredient of poultry feed, especially for broilers.</p>

                    <p className="mb-0">Soya DOC, a feed supplement, is considered a premium product because of its high digestibility, high energy content and consistency. It is an excellent source of protein and is used extensively in feed for swine, & dairy cattle, poultry, and aquaculture.</p>
                    <p className='mb-0'>The process of removing the oil from the soybeans can be undertaken by solvent extraction, hydraulic or expeller process in which the beans are first heated and then squeezed. In most of the cases it is designed and sold according to its protein content.</p>
                    <p className="mb-0">Soybean DOC is usually classified for marketing by its crude protein content or by the sum of protein + oil. There are two main categories, the ‘high-protein’ soybean meal with 49-50% of protein + oil and 3% crude fiber, obtained from de-hulled seeds, and the ‘low protein’ meal, with 44-46% protein + oil and 6-7% crude fiber, which contain the hulls. In ‘solvent-extracted soybean meals’, oil content is typically lower than 2%, while it exceeds 3% in mechanically-extracted meals.</p>
